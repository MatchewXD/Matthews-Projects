    <h1 class="box">Matthew's Projects</h1>
    <p class="box">Welcome! I am Matthew Seagren and these are my Projects!!! A bit about me, I am a new Software Developer and I still have a lot to learn. I want to be able to make projects on my own and with a team. I personally believe one of the greatest reasons for life is to serve others and I think the best way to serve others is to make things that people can use. For me I excel in math and science so what I can create are programs, apps and games. My goal is to work with a team of people who are creating things for people! It would be cool if it was at a job where I got paid but until then I will be working on projects and making useful things for peoples. Take a look at what I have already made!</p>
